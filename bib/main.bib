	abstract={With rapid advancements in infrared focal plane array (IRFPA) technology, greater demands are being placed on nonuniformity correction (NUC) techniques to provide near-BLIP performance over a wide dynamic range. Standard NUC techniques involve calibrating each detector using reference temperature sources before imaging the IRFPA. Usually the correction needs to be re-calibrated after a short period of time due to IRFPA drift or to adjust for changes in the level of background flux. Adaptive NUC techniques eliminate the need for calibration by continuously updating the correction coefficients based on radiance levels of the scene being viewed. In this manner, continuous compensation can be applied adaptively for individual detector non-idealities and background changes. Two adaptive NUC techniques are discussed; one is a temporal highpass filter and the other involves a neural network with lateral interconnects to nearest neighbor pixels. Both have similarities to biological retinal processing. Questions of implementation and stability are discussed and performance results are given for several test image sequences which were obtained from an MWIR HgCdTe array and a HIDAD uncooled array. We conclude that adaptive techniques will be very useful in future IRFPA sensors, primarily because of their ability to adapt over a wide range of background flux without calibration sources, but also because they can offer improved sensitivity under most operating conditions.},

The procedure is based on multiple irradiation sources and on least square fit approximations to the individual pixel response characteristics. Nonlinearities of the signal response are taken into account. A correctability figure of merit is defined which may be used to estimate the residual fixed-pattern noise after correction. The correction procedure and the correctability are applied to a real data set measured by a 64 脳 64 element infrared focal plane array (FPA). It is shown that an offset correction is insufficient for this data set and that a linear correction reduces the fixed-pattern noise contribution to the magnitude of the temporal noise background. The residual uncorrected fixed pattern noise can be related to pixels showing large temporal noise.},

Based on a comprehensive imaging model and an accurate parametric motion estimation, we are able to remove severe/structured nonuniformity and in the presence of subpixel motion to simultaneously improve image resolution. One important feature of our NUCSR method is the adoption of a parametric motion model that allows us to (1) handle many practical scenarios where parametric motions are present and (2) carry out perfect super-resolution in principle by exploring available subpixel motions. Experiments with real data demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed NUCE framework and the effectiveness of the NUCSR method.},

Nonuniformity can be extremely problematic, especially for mid- to far-infrared imaging systems. The technique is based on use of estimates of interframe subpixel shifts in an image sequence, in conjunction with a linear-interpolation model for the motion, to extract information on the bias nonuniformity algebraically. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed by using real infrared and simulated data. One advantage of this technique is its simplicity; it requires relatively few frames to generate an effective correction matrix, thereby permitting the execution of frequent on-the-fly nonuniformity correction as drift occurs. Additionally, the performance is shown to exhibit considerable robustness with respect to lack of the common types of temporal and spatial irradiance diversity that are typically required by statistical scene-based nonuniformity correction techniques.},

	keywords={Image Sequence Processing;Infrared Focal Plane Arrays;Nonuniformity Correction Method;Recursive Filtering},
	abstract={Summary: In [1] we presented a recursive filter to estimate the detector offset nonuniformity (NU) noise present in infrared (IR) imaging systems. Such a filter was derived considering an estimation time-window short enough so that the offset NU can be regarded as a constant in noise. Since the offset NU is non-stationary, upon the arrival of new blocks of IR data new estimates of the offset NU have to be computed. In this paper, this recursive filter is extended by adding to the so-called intra-block processing (where offset NU is a constant) an inter-block processing algorithm. The inter-block processing algorithm considers the time varying effect in the offset NU and models it as a discrete-time Gauss-Markov random process. So, the extended filter is designed to compensate continuously for the NU when new blocks of frames arrive. In addition, the theoretical analysis of the estimator provides us expressions for selecting the appropriate parameters required by the algorithm. The ability of the method to compensate for the offset NU is demonstrated by employing several mid-wavelength IR video sequences.},

Second, the estimated scene, along with its corresponding observed data obtained by detectors, is employed to update the gain and the bias by means of a line-fitting technique. Finally, with these nonuniformity parameters, the compensated output of each detector is obtained by computing a very simple formula. The advantages of the proposed algorithm lie in its low computational complexity and storage requirements and ability to capture temporal drifts in the nonuniformity parameters.

	year={2018},
	abstract={The residual non uniformity of IR detectors is of major concern in the implementation of innovative IR systems. Several algorithms were developed during the last decade in order to solve this problem. One of these algorithms, "Scene based non uniformity correction" (SBNUC), is based on the notion that for a moving thermal imager, close by pixels get over time similar distributions of scene radiation. Following this assumption, differences between the time collected histograms of pixels are due to non uniformity and can thus be corrected. However, pixels which are not in the closest proximity of each other need in general more time for their histograms to match. Moreover, depending on the imager motion characteristics, there can be additional temporal and spatial limitations. An efficient SBNUC algorithm must take the exact limitations into consideration. In this work the SBNUC spatial-temporal relations are investigated using the spatial frequency domain representation. This representation provides an effective point of view since distances in the image are naturally translated into different spatial frequencies. We show that a way to implement this correction by a recursive time filter incorporates spatial frequency dependence into the correction speed, allowing the spatial-temporal relation to be engineered easily into the correction process. Using several characteristic imager motion models we analyze the effect of the motion on the spatialtemporal relations and demonstrate how an optimal SBNUC process can be designed, for each motion model.},

The algorithm relies on the ability to register a sequence of observed frames in the presence of the fixed-pattern noise caused by pixel-to-pixel nonuniformity. In low-to-moderate levels of nonuniformity, sufficiently accurate registration may be possible with standard scene-based registration techniques. If the registration is accurate, and motion exists between the frames, then groups of independent detectors can be identified that observe the same irradiance (or true scene value). These detector outputs are averaged to generate estimates of the true scene values. With these scene estimates, and the corresponding observed values through a given detector, a curve-fitting procedure is used to estimate the individual detector response parameters. These can then be used to correct for detector nonuniformity. The strength of the algorithm lies in its simplicity and low computational complexity. Experimental results, to illustrate the performance of the algorithm, include the use of visible-range imagery with simulated nonuniformity and infrared imagery with real nonuniformity.},

	abstract={Imaging system mentioned in this work is made up of a cryogenic infrared focal array (IR FPA). Images acquired from such system always have degradations due to diffraction and aberration in the optical system, atmospheric degradation source, relative motion between the camera and the original scene, integral sampling of the detector arrays, defocusing and so on. Restoration is essential to an infrared imaging system. The degradation model based on a convolution product is presented, and a restoration method based on a modified Wiener filter is proposed. Newton-Raphson method is used in the optimal parameter search procedure. The model is based on the uniform detectors assumption, but in practical applications such assumption cannot be satisfied. So a pre-process is needed to correct the nonuniformity to meet the assumption. Blind pixels compensation is also included in the pre-process procedure. Moreover, to avoid the ringing that may be created by Wiener filter, a boundary expansion method is applied before restoration procedure. To assess the restoration effect, we select image definition as the measurement criteria, and the calculation results show that the restored images have much higher definition than the degraded image. The restoration procedure is applied to an Oriental Pearl infrared image.},

We initially execute one-point calibration to the perimeter detectors, then based on controllable motion of adjacent frames, a special algebraic algorithm is proposed to transport the calibration of the perimeter detectors to those interior un-corrected ones. In this way, the bias parameter of the whole field of view (FOV) is calculated. The algorithm can be easily combined with sub-pixel imaging, thereby improving the quality of thermal imaging system (image spatial resolution and uniformity). All calculations are algebraic, with a low computation load. The algorithm can realize adaptive one point calibration without covering the central FOV rapidly. Experiments on simulated infrared data demonstrate that this algorithm requires only dozens of frames to obtain high quality corrections.},

	abstract={In scene-based nonuniformity correction (NUC) methods for infrared focal plane array cameras, the statistical approaches have been well studied because of their lower computational complexity. However, when the assumptions imposed by statistical algorithms are violated, their performance is poor. Moreover, many of these techniques, like the global constant statistics method, usually need tens of thousands of image frames to obtain a good NUC result. In this paper, we introduce a new statistical NUC method called the multiscale constant statistics (MSCS). The MSCS statically considers that the spatial scale of the temporal constant distribution expands over time. Under the assumption that the nonuniformity is distributed in a higher spatial frequency domain, the spatial range for gain and offset estimates gradually expands to guarantee fast compensation for nonuniformity. Furthermore, an exponential window and a tolerance interval for the acquired data are introduced to capture the drift in nonuniformity and eliminate the ghosting artifacts. The strength of the proposed method lies in its simplicity, low computational complexity, and its good trade-off between convergence rate and correction precision. The NUC ability of the proposed method is demonstrated by using infrared video sequences with both synthetic and real nonuniformity.},

	abstract={Going with Infrared Focal Plane Array (IRFPA) development, the application of infrared imaging system is more and more extensive, it's well known that the Non-Uniformity Correction (NUC) is the only necessary data soft processing in the whole infrared imaging data link, it will be seen from this that the NUC quality stand or fall influences the final imaging product quality directly, for target detection and identification system, it increases the complexity and timeliness of the target detection and identification algorithm undoubtedly. Currently, the Non-Uniformity Correction (NUC) algorithm can be divided two classifications: the one is that Non-Uniformity Correction based on calibration source, this algorithm assumes the infrared system response characteristic is linear, takes the dark current and gain as the two correction parameters, but for nonlinear, especially for the response drift characteristic and the ambient temperature change, the higher the system sensibility is, the greater the influence is and the higher the design requirements for system stray radiation are. The correction effectiveness is limited seriously; the another is adaptive correction algorithm based on scene (SBNUC), it can be subdivided time domain, space domain and motion estimation processing algorithms, although it do not need physical calibration source and also reduces the influence of system response drift to a certain degree, but the requirement is rigorous for statistics specimen and size, and the rapidity of convergence and stability are different. In this paper, according to blind information source decomposition technique, the infrared image is divided to signal and noise as two information sources, a new Non-Uniformity Correction method based on Fast Independent Component (FastICA) blind separation is put forward. By means of the experimental contrast analysis for the linear correction algorithm and constant statistics algorithm of real infrared image, by this new algorithm, the influence of the system response drift and the ambient temperature change for the linear correction algorithm based on physical calibration source is not only suppressed, but also the shortages of the scene-based Non-Uniformity correction (SBNUC) in statistics specimen and size are overcome partly. The experimental result proved the effectiveness of this algorithm in the paper which effectively separated the signal and noise of the infrared image. At the same time, the algorithm in the paper supplied a new solution of Non-Uniformity Correction (NUC) by the experiment.},

The gating is designed to significantly reduce ghosting artifacts produced by many scene-based NUC algorithms by halting updates when temporal variation is lacking. We define the algorithm and present a number of experimental results to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in comparison to several previously published methods including other LMS and constant statistics based methods. The experimental results include simulated imagery and a real infrared image sequence. We show that the proposed method significantly reduces ghosting artifacts, but has a slightly longer convergence time. (c) 2009 Optical Society of America},

	abstract={Current infra-red focal point arrays (IRFPAs) are limited by their inability to calibrate out component variations. Typically, off-board digital calibration is used to correct nonuniformities in these detector arrays; special calibration images are used to calibrate the system at startup. One-time calibration procedures such as these do not take into account other operating points and will fail to recalibrate for any drift in the parameters. Using clues from neurobiological adaptation, we have developed the constant-statistics (CS) algorithm for nonuniformity correction of IRFPAs. Gain and offset variations are successfully calibrated using simple assumptions of the scene under view. We give results for calibration of 1D and 2D images using a digital implementation. We also show that the constant-statistics algorithm compares favorably to an existing LMS-based nonuniformity correction algorithm by Scribner in terms of convergence rate and computational complexity. Finally, we review the results of analog circuitry that was designed and fabricated with a 2 micrometer CMOS technology. Measured results from our test-chip show that the system achieves invariance to gain and offset variations of the input signal. This hardware is targeted for eventual use for in- and behind- the focal plane implementations.},

	abstract={The non-uniform response in infrared focal plane array (IRFPA) detectors produces corrupted images with a fixed-pattern noise. In this paper we present an enhanced adaptive scene-based non-uniformity correction (NUC) technique. The method simultaneously estimates detector's parameters and performs the non-uniformity compensation using a neural network approach. In addition, the proposed method doesn't make any assumption on the kind or amount of non-uniformity presented on the raw data. The strength and robustness of the proposed method relies in avoiding the presence of ghosting artifacts through the use of optimization techniques in the parameter estimation learning process, such as: momentum, regularization, and adaptive learning rate. The proposed method has been tested with video sequences of simulated and real infrared data taken with an InSb IRFPA, reaching high correction levels, reducing the fixed pattern noise, decreasing the ghosting, and obtaining an effective frame by frame adaptive estimation of each detector's gain and offset.},

	abstract={In an earlier work, a recursive filter to compensate for the offset nonuniformity (NU) noise corrupting the output of infrared (IR) imaging system was presented. Such a filter was derived assuming an estimation time-window short enough so that the offset NU can be regarded as a constant corrupted by additive noise. In this paper, the assumption on the stationarity of the offset NU noise has been relaxed by characterizing the dynamics of the offset NU using a Gauss鈥揗arkov random process. Based upon this model, a recursive filter that uses blocks of IR data to estimate the offset NU has been derived. A rigorous theoretical analysis of the filter has been conducted in order to provide expressions for appropriately selecting the parameters of the filter. The ability of the block-recursive filter to compensate for NU noise has been tested using raw IR videos from different IR cameras. In addition, the filter has been implemented and tested on-line in a prototype spectrally tunable IR camera.},

	abstract={The spatial fixed-pattern noise (FPN) inherently generated in infrared (IR) imaging systems compromises severely the quality of the acquired imagery, even making such images inappropriate for some applications. The FPN refers to the inability of the photodetectors in the focal-plane array to render a uniform output image when a uniform-intensity scene is being imaged. We present a noise-cancellation-based algorithm that compensates for the additive component of the FPN. The proposed method relies on the assumption that a source of noise correlated to the additive FPN is available to the IR camera. An important feature of the algorithm is that all the calculations are reduced to a simple equation, which allows for the bias compensation of the raw imagery. The algorithm performance is tested using real IR image sequences and is compared to some classical methodologies.},

	//abstract={A novel statistical approach is undertaken for the adaptive estimation of the gain and bias nonuniformity in infrared focal-plane array sensors from scene data. The gain and the bias of each detector are regarded as random state variables modeled by a discrete-time Gauss-Markov process. The proposed Gauss-Markov framework provides a mechanism for capturing the slow and random drift in the fixed-pattern noise as the operational conditions of the sensor vary in time. With a temporal stochastic model for each detector's gain and bias at hand, a Kalman filter is derived that uses scene data, comprising the detector's readout values sampled over a short period of time, to optimally update the detector's gain and bias estimates as these parameters drift. The proposed technique relies on a certain spatiotemporal diversity condition in the data, which is satisfied when all detectors see approximately the same range of temperatures within the periods between successive estimation epochs. The performance of the proposed technique is thoroughly studied, and its utility in mitigating fixed-pattern noise is demonstrated with both real infrared and simulated imagery.},

	abstract={What is to our knowledge a new scene-based algorithm for nonuniformity correction in infrared focal-plane array sensors has been developed. The technique is based on the inverse covariance form of the Kalman filter (KF), which has been reported previously and used in estimating the gain and bias of each detector in the array from scene data. The gain and the bias of each detector in the focal-plane array are assumed constant within a given sequence of frames, corresponding to a certain time and operational conditions, but they are allowed to randomly drift from one sequence to another following a discrete-time Gauss-Markov process. The inverse covariance form filter estimates the gain and the bias of each detector in the focal-plane array and optimally updates them as they drift in time. The estimation is performed with considerably higher computational efficiency than the equivalent KF. The ability of the algorithm in compensating for fixed-pattern noise in infrared imagery and in reducing the computational complexity is demonstrated by use of both simulated and real data.},

The proposed algorithm is based on using a bank of Kalman filters in parallel. Each filter independently estimates state variables comprising the gain and the bias matrices of the sensor, according to its own dynamic-model parameters. The supervising component of the algorithm then generates the final estimates of the state variables by forming a weighted superposition of all the estimates rendered by each Kalman filter. The weights are computed and updated iteratively, according to the a posteriori-likelihood principle. The performance of the estimator and its ability to compensate for fixed-pattern noise is tested using both simulated and real data obtained from two operating in the mid- and long-wave infrared regime.},
